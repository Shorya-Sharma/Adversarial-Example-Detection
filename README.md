# Adversarial Example Detection in Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains the implementation of my B.Tech project, which focuses on detecting adversarial examples in deep neural networks (DNNs). The project explores the use of statistical metrics applied to the activation values of intermediate layers to detect adversarial inputs and improve the security of machine learning models.

## Project Overview
Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examplesâ€”inputs deliberately crafted to mislead the model. This project proposes a novel method to detect adversarial examples by analyzing the behavior of DNNs when exposed to both clean and adversarial data. The approach leverages **layer-wise statistical metrics** from intermediate activations to build a robust detector.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** 
- **TensorFlow** / **PyTorch**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualizations)
- **Scikit-learn** (for statistical metrics)
